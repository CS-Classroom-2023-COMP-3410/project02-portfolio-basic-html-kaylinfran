Project 2 - Personal Portfolio - Web Programming - Kaylin Francisco

Reflection:
For this assignment, I decided to add ideas as I went along, I didn't plan any of the pages before hand. This helped
me learn as I went along because when I got an idea, I would sometimes run into the issue of not knowing how to correctly format an item. When this happened, I liked to use my resources like the in-class slides and also the W3 website was a great resource to figure out errors that I was getting. One issue that I ran into that I was not able to fix was on the contact me page, when a user inputs their info and hit submit, the page successfully opens up the email page. However the forms input does not transfer over, I was not able to figure that part out. I made sure the format was the same as the in-class slides but it didn't seem to work. Other than that, everything looked the way I 
wanted it to.
